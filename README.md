### Taskivist is a simple to-do list web app, built with JavaScript.

It lets you organize your tasks and memorize them easily. You just need to add the task name and assign a date to it, or you can leave it with no date.

You can also edit task details, mark it as completed, delete it, or delete all tasks.

The web app deals with local storage to save the submitted data.
